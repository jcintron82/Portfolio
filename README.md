Tis is my personal portfolio which showcases my most recent work as a Web Developer. This is a project that is constanly being updated and changed but my main goal from the beginning was to provide a sleek and easy to digest webpage to get my skills across to my viewer concisely and effectively. So far only HTML and CSS were used to create this webpage although I do have specific plans which will involve Javascript in the near future.
